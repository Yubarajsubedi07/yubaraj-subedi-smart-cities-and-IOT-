            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A smart city is a urban area that uses different types of electronic methods and sensors to collect data and then use insights gained from that data to manage assets, resources and services efficiently. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in making cities smarter by connecting various devices and systems.</p>

            <h2>IoT Applications in Smart Cities</h2>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) enables various applications in smart cities, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Transportation:</strong> IoT sensors and devices can monitor traffic flow, optimize public transportation routes, and provide real-time information to commuters.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Energy Management:</strong> IoT systems can regulate energy consumption in buildings, streetlights, and other infrastructure to reduce waste and improve efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Monitoring:</strong> IoT sensors can measure air quality, detect pollution levels, and monitor water usage to help cities better manage their environmental impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Safety:</strong> IoT-enabled surveillance cameras, emergency response systems, and predictive analytics can enhance public safety by identifying and responding to potential threats more effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> IoT sensors can optimize waste collection routes, monitor trash levels in bins, and promote recycling efforts to make waste management more efficient.</li>
            </ul>
